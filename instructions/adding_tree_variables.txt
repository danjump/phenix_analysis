These are the files that need to be changed when adding a tree variable:

get_phys_dists/phys_hist_definitions.h
  -change n_dists
  -change arrays with names & bounds
    -NOTE: if you add to the middle of the array there
    are several other files with changes required when
    accessing later array entries.
  -add branches to definition of basic_cuts_tree and wness_tree

get_phys_dists/get_phys_dists.C
  -define variable with which to fill (get from input file if needed)
  -set branch address for basic_cuts_tree

/utilities/combine_files/merge_other_triggers.C
  -set branch addresses for the 3 trees

/wness_preselection/wness_preselection.C
  -define a variable and set branch address for basic_cuts_tree
  -add entries in defining phys_dists[] array
  -set branch address again for basic_cuts_tree
  -set branch address for wness_tree
